## (a) A point is given in a coordinate system: B = (7, 8). What is the vector going from (0, 0) to B?  
point a = 0,0 point b= 7,8 vector = 7,8

## (b) Two points, A and B, in a coordinate system are given by A = (4, 3), B = (7, 8). The vector ~a goes from A to B. What is ~a?
point a = 4,3 point b= 7,8 vector = 3,5

## (c) Given vector ~a = (3/5) what is its magnitude |~a| (its length)?
3^2 + 5^2 = 34  âˆš34 = 5.83
