## (a) A point is given in a coordinate system: B = (7, 8). What is the vector going from (0, 0) to B?  
point a = 0,0 point b= 7,8 vector = 7,8

## (b) Two points, A and B, in a coordinate system are given by A = (4, 3), B = (7, 8). The vector ~a goes from A to B. What is ~a?
point a = 4,3 point b= 7,8 vector = 3,5

## (c) Given vector ~a = (3/5) what is its magnitude |~a| (its length)?
3^2 + 5^2 = 34  √34 = 5.83

## (d) What is the resulting vector of their combined pull ~res?
res = (7,0)

## (e) Given three vectors, ~a = (3/2), ~b =(5/1) , ~c =(−2/6) calculate

### 1. ~a +~b 
(3/2) + (5,1) = (8/3)
### 2. ~b + ~c 
(5/1) +  (-2/6) = (3/7)
### 3. (~a +~b) + ~c
((3/2) + (5,1)) + (-2/6) = (6/9)
### 4. ~a + (~b + ~c)
(3/2) + ((5/1)(-2/6)) = (6/9) 
### 5. ~b + ~a
(-2/6) + (5/1) = (3/7)
